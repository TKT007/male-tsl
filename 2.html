                                <em>A</em>ngela and Yoojin Kim, conquered the investors with a blue salt trick — a male gummy supplement sold over-the-counter: a possible cure for erectile dysfunction.
                                <br><br>
                                The two sisters, Angela and Yoojin Kim, researchers and chemists from Harvard University, had the big moment of closing the largest deal in the history of American television on Shark Tank, when the six biggest investors heard about the "blue salt trick" and teamed up to invest an impressive $3.5 million in the company.
                                <br><br>
                                In just six months, the blue salt trick proved to be so innovative and revolutionary in the U.S. health sector that, with the support of all six Shark Tank hosts, the big pharmaceutical industries saw their billion-dollar revenues drop day by day. Backed by Shark Tank, they are conquering the global market and increasing Big Pharma’s losses.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>After the discovery of the blue salt trick, it was understood that it is ten times more powerful than Viagra</strong> and can provide the biggest and longest-lasting erection of your life in less than ten seconds. With the complete formulation of the brand and packaging, the two Harvard sisters are now ready to officially launch the new <b>AlphaGummy</b>.
                                <br><br>
                                Now see how they came up with this salt trick, which made the Sharks fight to invest:
                                <br><br>
                                <b>The Kim sisters, who are chemical researchers at Harvard University, discovered that the salt trick contains three 100% natural compounds that help cleanse the blood of toxins and naturally boost testosterone production</b>. The main compound is citrulline, which stimulates the body’s natural production of testosterone. It acts as a lethal weapon against the toxins that affect this hormone, in addition to promoting an increase of 4 to 9 centimeters and boosting libido.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>The increase in testosterone production happens regardless of age — whether you're a 30-year-old man or 80 — hormone levels begin to rise significantly again.</b>
                                <br><br>
                                I’m sure you’ve already seen all sorts of supplements with Viagra, tadalafil, penis pumps, and other products that promise penile growth. But one truth that few talk about is the health risks caused by these products, such as heart problems, high blood pressure, complications for those with diabetes, and even vision loss.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>
                                    <i>
                                What sets the Kim sisters' product apart is that it is the first reuptake inhibitor (RI), which makes it much more effective in retaining testosterone in the body for longer.
                                    </i>
                                </strong>
                                <br><br>
                                RIs work by blocking the reuptake process of neurotransmitters by neurons, allowing them to stay active longer in the synapses. In other words, for those who don’t have a PhD in chemistry: <strong>a possible definitive cure for erectile dysfunction.

                            <i><strong>Known as the Harvard sisters, they were the first participants in the history of American television and Shark Tank to receive an investment offer that united all six judges, who even argued among themselves to invest together.</strong>

                                Very little is said about the gigantic multi-billion dollar market of the male health industry. Research conducted by major pharmaceutical companies, available on the market, <b>shows that most men between the ages of 35 and 80 have already faced some kind of failure “at the crucial moment”</b> with their partners or suffer from erectile dysfunction.
<br><br>
                                And an even more impressive statistic: 80% of men say they are not satisfied with the size of their genital organ, even with the use of the famous “blue pill.”

                                Billionaire Robert Herjavec, one of the most renowned judges on Shark Tank, didn’t hold back when commenting on the impact of the new product created by the Kim sisters:
                                <br><br>
                                <strong><i>“This is an industry that has long been thirsty for a definitive solution. People are tired of those blue pills that don’t work. Everyone knows those products don’t help with the problem and still cause harm with their side effects. I’m excited to work with the Kim sisters and looking forward to scaling up production globally."</i></strong> 
                                 <br><br>
                                The major investor and CEO of Vitabiotics, Tej Lalvani, a British businessman who owns major laboratories in England, made a point of testing AlphaGummy himself and understanding more about the blue salt trick present in its formula.
                                <br><br>
                                Clinical studies conducted by his team, with the most renowned British scientists, reached impressive results: <b>97% of men between the ages of 35 and 80 who participated reported performance similar to what they had in their 20s</b>, with longer-lasting erections — up to 2 hours — and penile growth of 2 to 5 centimeters.
                                <br><br>
                                Since AlphaGummy (the product used in the clinical trials) is not yet available in stores, Mr. Lalvani has arranged exclusive offers for our readers!

                            <h4>So Whats In AlphaGummy?</h4>

                                Together with the six Shark Tanks, the Kim sisters formed a partnership with one of the largest and safest laboratories in the United States to produce this formula on a large scale, maintaining a high standard of efficiency, purity, and quality, with the approval of the Sharks.
                                <br><br>
                                That’s why it was decided to encapsulate this powerful formula, which is becoming Big Pharma’s greatest enemy in America. The formula went through various quality tests, received FDA approval, and was finally made available: 100% natural and proven effective, using powerful compounds.
                                <br><br>
                                Inside each <strong>AlphaGummy</strong> there’s a potent combination of natural ingredients: L-Arginine, Maca root, Tribulus Terrestris, Ginkgo Biloba, potency wood, and oyster shell extracts. These herbal components have been used by Chinese herbalists for over 5,000 years as allies for male health. They help remove toxins from the body and strengthen the penile muscle, providing long-lasting erections at any time of the day or night, regardless of age. You’ll have steel-hard erections — to satisfy your partner and leave her weak in the knees.
                                <br><br>
                                What truly makes <strong>AlphaGummy</strong> unique is its patented <strong>TRTT</strong> technology, which allows the body to absorb these ingredients with 185 times more efficiency than in traditional form.
                                <br><br>
                                Without a doubt, this investment by the six big Shark Tank millionaires has a profit potential up to 10 times greater than any other ever made on the show...
                                <br><br>
                                You must be thinking: “Does it really work?” — that’s exactly what the Sharks wondered.
                                <br><br>
                                After the partnership between the Kim sisters and the Shark Tank investors in creating <strong>AlphaGummy</strong>, actor <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> got in touch with Robert Herjavec — one of the show’s judges and his close friend — to test the product for six months.

</p><p>
                                Hugh is a married man for the last 27 years to his beautiful wife, Deborra-Lee. Hugh
                                also suffers from ED and expressed the fact that his sex life with Deborra-Lee has been
                                struggling ever since his poor sexual performance. Hugh has been using <strong>AlphaGummy</strong>
                                for the last 5 months.

                                He said he had tried all kinds of treatments: blue pills, injections, and other alternatives — all of which resulted in severe side effects that almost cost him his life. According to Hugh, his sexual performance dropped even more, and even his acting performance was affected, a direct result of these treatments, which many Americans also use.
                                <br><br>
                                For the past six months, Hugh has been using <strong>AlphaGummy</strong>, and the results, according to him, have been life-changing.

                                I couldn’t wait to see if AlphaGummy was everything people were saying. Robert always talked about the project and the benefits it brought, and it was exactly what I needed, especially after he mentioned the so-called blue salt trick.
                                <br><br>
                                 I took a AlphaGummy at night, before going to bed, and told my wife it was a vitamin. In less than 15 minutes, I felt my penis go from soft to rock hard. I stayed aroused for 1 hour and 29 minutes!
                                 <br><br>
                                 Deborra had no idea what had happened — that night, I was able to give her two orgasms for the first time in years.
                                 <br><br>
                                   To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. I said to Robert, “Buddy, are you sure you’re not getting on a sinking ship?”
                                   <br><br>
                                    I really didn’t think a natural gummy, even with that blue salt trick, could have such an effect.

                            Look, before discovering AlphaGummy, I spent thousands of dollars on blue pills, injections... and none of those expensive treatments managed to solve my problem with erectile dysfunction (ED).

                                So, instead of making promises to our readers, we challenge you to follow in the footsteps of Hugh and the six major Shark Tank hosts and try it for yourself!
                                <br><br>
                                Like Hugh, once you start using <strong>AlphaGummy</strong>, you won’t just have long-lasting rock-hard erections whenever you need them. One of the things many men already using it point out is the immediate boost in testosterone. The benefits are visible: more strength, muscle gain, fat burning, endurance during sex, and control over ejaculation, with increased semen volume during climax. Your partner will be left weak in the knees and will think you’ve become a real porn star.
                                <br><br>
                                <b>How much is it worth to you to be able to have sex for 40, 50, or even 60 minutes non-stop?</b> To have a bigger, thicker penis, more energy, higher testosterone levels, and the true admiration and devotion of a woman who becomes addicted to your “member”?
                                <br><br>
                             Many people would pay over $3,000. You saw how much Hugh spent without seeing any real results — until he made the best decision: requesting six packs. Today, he’d easily pay over $10,000, because he now understands the benefits of AlphaGummy — or better yet, he’s experienced them. His marriage has completely transformed.
                                <br><br>
                                We reached out to the Shark Tank team regarding this story we’re sharing with our readers. Their team kindly got back to us and had no objections to us publishing this report.

                                However, they did inform us that major pharmaceutical companies are doing everything they can to suppress information about this product, as they’re rapidly losing market share to AlphaGummy due to its impressive success and real-world results. As a result, these companies are working to take down all reports and content about this breakthrough product.
